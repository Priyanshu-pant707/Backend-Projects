# What is JWT ?
- a jwt is a compact ,URL-safe string used to securely transfer claims (small pieces of data) between two parties . It's commanly used for the stateless authentication
- the server gives a token after lgon and the client sends it with future requests to prove identity.


- A ***JWT*** = `header.playload.signature` each of the first two parts are base64Url-encoded json.



# structure :

1. ***Header*** : - algorithm and token type 
```json
{
    "alg" : "HS256",
    "typ" : "JWT"
}
```

2. ***Playload*** - data inside token. Two types:
- ***Registered Claims (standard)*** : `iss`(issuer) ,`sub`(subject),`aud`(audience),`exp`(expiry timestamp),`iat`(issued at),`nbf`(not before).
- ***Custom claims*** : role,userId.

```json
{ 
    "sub": "1234",
    "role": "user", 
    "iat": 1698499200, 
    "exp": 1698502800 
}
```

3. ***Signature***
- created by signing `Base64Url(header) + "." + Base64Url(payload)`
with a secret (HMAC) or private key (RSA/EC). Ensures the token wasn't tampered with.



# functions:
 1. ***jwt.sign()***
    - this function is used to generate a new jwt token based om thje provided payload options.
    - it take three parameters :
        1. payload :  this the data you want to include in the token. it can be any json object containing user information,metadata,or any other relavent data.
        2. secret or private key :  this is the secret key used to sign the token .it can be string or a buffer containing a secret cryptographic key.
        3.  optional : these are additional options that control the behavior of the token generatiopn process , such as expiration time (expiresIN), algorithm (algorithm) ,and more.
```js
const jwt= require('jsonwebtoken');


// payload containing user information
const payload ={
    userId : '123456',
    username : 'exampleuser'
};

//secret key 
const secretKey='set_your_secret_key';

// generate a new jwt token
const token= jwt.sign(payload,secretKey,{
    expiresIn : '1h'
});

```



 2. ***jwt.verify()***

- this function is used to verify and decode a jwt to retrieve the original payload.
- it takes three parameters : 
    1. token :  the jwt token to be verified.
    2. secret or publicKey :  the secret key or public key used to verify the token signature. if the token was signed using a symmetric algorithm , you need to provide the same secret key used to sign the token.  if it was signed using an asymmetric algorithm , you need to provide the public key corressponding to the private key used for signing.
    3. Options (optional) : Additional options for verification, such as algorithms , audience,issuer and more.
